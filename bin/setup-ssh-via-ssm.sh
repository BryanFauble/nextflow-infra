# This script uploads your public SSH key ('id_ed25519' by default)
# to the home directories of 'ec2-user' and 'ssm-user'. While both
# users are configured, it's recommended to use 'ec2-user' for SSH.
# Written by Bruno Grande.
#
# Script usage:
#
#   bash setup-ssh-via-ssm.sh INSTANCE_ID [PUBLIC_SSH_KEY]
#
# Example commands:
#
#   # Generic usage:
#   bash setup-ssh-via-ssm.sh i-0d3ff331a7b7a7e8b
#
#   # If you have another SSH key that you want to use,
#   # which should match your SSH config file (see below):
#   bash setup-ssh-via-ssm.sh i-0d3ff331a7b7a7e8b ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
#
#
# This script assumes that:
#
# - You have generated an ed25519 SSH key pair as per
#   GitHub's best practices. Otherwise, you'll need to
#   generate one using:
#
#     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
#
# - Your shell environment is configured with AWS credentials
#   (AWS_PROFILE or AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY).
#   For example, if you have an AWS CLI profile based on the
#   Service Catalog docs, you will first need to run this:
#
#     export AWS_PROFILE=service-catalog
#
#   Tip: If you only use the AWS CLI for the Service Catalog,
#   consider making the config profile the default as follows:
#
#     [default]
#     region=us-east-1
#     credential_process = ...
#
# - Your SSH configuration file includes the following snippet
#   (update the value for 'IdentityFile' as appropriate):
#
#     Host i-* mi-*
#         ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
#         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
#         User ec2-user
#

# Command-line arguments and optional environment variables
INSTANCE_ID="${1}"
SSH_KEY_PUB="${2:-$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub}"
